Our (Not So) Dirty Secret

It almost seems like it's been a lifetime since we first decided to get together. The start of an adventure! To take those first few chords you learn and to try to turn them into a song. The sounds we created were young and naive, but most of all? We found the process exciting! With the future bright in our minds, we hit the road. To try and see what all the fuss was about! Honestly, we thought were going to be the next big thing.

Boy, were we wrong!

Through a lot of ups and down, a real roller coaster, the band changed. Life has a funny way of interfering with things, and the band just (kinda) seemed to stall for a long time.

So, fast forward. With no major plans or expectations, we decided in July 2015 to go back into the rehearsal room and work on completely new ideas. With a little bit more experience and a little more confidence, we invested months into writing. Constantly reworking our music, we did all we were all able to do alone. We had something, and we weren't quite sure what it was. But most importantly, it was something we believed in.

So we reached out, looking for some common ground. Through many calls, emails and meetings, we found ourselves in London a year later, working with some of the best in the business.

So, here we are! We're excited to begin our new adventure, and to all our fans? We really cannot wait to give you a sneak peek at[INDIEPENDENCE Music & Arts Festival][0]2016, to give you an exclusive preview of our (not so) dirty secret!

The Elation
