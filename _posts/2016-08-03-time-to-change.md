  We posted earlier this week a segment regarding the bands past and more
  importantly our future plans. We have been blown away by the reaction we got
  from everybody and we want to thank those who showed us support. Whilst riding
  this wave, Yesterday we hit our biggest milestone to date as we opened up the
  beer hall stage for this years INDIEPENDENCE Music & Arts Festival. Not only
  was this the first time we played the festival but we also took the
  opportunity to launch our brand new original band 'THE ELATION'. We played a
  host of new music and we loved every minute of it. We have so much news to
  share with you over the next couple of weeks and we promise to keep you all
  posted on our exciting new journey. Until then here's one of our favourite
  shots from indie16 of our fans at the first ever 'The Elation' show.
